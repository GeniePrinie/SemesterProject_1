              <h2>Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                in this world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
                we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time
                to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our
                Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders
                of the tiny world.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
                the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                first heart transplant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
                the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our
                fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <p>
              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.

              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
              currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
              and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
              contribute to a brighter future.
